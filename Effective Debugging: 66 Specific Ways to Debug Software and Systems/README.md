## ISSUE-TRACKING SYSTEM

The creators of the GitQlient project have placed the rules for reporting and describing errors in the .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug.md path. In addition, however, this system is very well described on [this website](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). Besides that, on [this page](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/bug-severity-vs-priority) you can find a good article about bugs severities and priorities and on [this page](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-your-work-on-github/tracking-the-progress-of-your-work-with-project-boards) you can find informations about how to document a progress.
