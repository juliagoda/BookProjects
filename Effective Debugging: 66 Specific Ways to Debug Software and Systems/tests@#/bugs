Title: Program's exit after pinning a project from main program window causes crash.
Severity: Minor (all steps performed after this, but before closing the program are correctly evaluated and remembered by the program)
Priority: High
Affected stakeholders: Everyone

**Describe the bug**
Closing the program window after trying to pin the project from the main window will cause crash.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior (from bottom to top because of crash type):
1. Open application
2. Open any path of git project
3. Go back to main page
4. Click on right button of mouse
5. If there is as first written:
a) "Unpin" 
  1) Click on it
  2) Click on it again after the text is changed to "Pin"
b) "Pin"
  1) Click on it
6. Close the application window (not from menu)

**Expected behavior**
Not only should the project be connected and disconnected in project tab, but also the program should close properly.

**Screenshots**


**Desktop (please complete the following information):**
 - OS: Arch Linux
 - Release version or SHA: v1.3.0-beta
 - If manually compiled, compiler version: QMake version 3.1 (Using Qt version 5.15.2)


**Additional context**
Uninning triggers a reaction that does not lead to an error in the program. Only the pinning operation causes an error. 
Sometimes a new tab may appear in the upper left corner without content but with an option to close
